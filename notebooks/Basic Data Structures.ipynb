    "# Basic Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Data Structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to plot hourly precipitation measurements from a rain gauge on a bar graph. Your first step will be to put the precipitation data inside a Python data structure. Data structures are how computer programs store information. This information can subsequently be processed, analyzed and visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of data structures depending on the kind of data you wish to store. You will have to choose data structures that best meet your requirements for the problem you are trying to solve. Fortunately, Python as a \"batteries-included\" language gives you a practical choice of data structures to select from. We will do a minimal exploration of Python data structures; just enough to get you going. For a more complete treatment of Python data structures, see the [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) section in the Python documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "First, scientific data can be large and complex and may require data structures appropriate for *scientific* programming. We cover Python for scientific data further along in the [Scientific Python Package](http://unidata.github.io/online-python-training/) section. This notebook covers basic Python data structures meant for general-purpose programming, necessary to write programs in any capacity. Choosing the right data structure for the problem you are targeting will help your programs run correctly and efficiently, and make them easier for others to understand. We will specifically examine three Python data structures: lists, tuples, both Python sequences, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers several data structures to store sequences of information such as hourly mean sea level pressure readings from a weather station, or three-dimensional coordinates describing a location in a climate model. To accommodate storage of such data, Python has a few different choices. We will discuss two of them: lists and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python list is a sequence of values that are usually the same kind of item. They are ordered, which means items of a list stay in the order they are inserted in. They can contain strings, numbers, or more complex items. Lists are mutable, which is a fancy way of saying they can be changed after they are created. Here is a Python list of [decadal concentrations of carbon dioxide (ppm) measured at the Mauna Loa observatory](https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/ghg/ghg-concentrations.html) from 1970 to 2010 assigned to the `co2` variable."

We can use the `append` *method* to add an item to the end of the list. ([A method is like a function](https://github.com/Unidata/online-python-training/blob/master/notebooks/Times%20and%20Dates.ipynb#The-Thirty-Second-Introduction-to-Object-Oriented-Programming), but denoted with the `.` notation after the variable it is acting on.
