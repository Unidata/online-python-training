    "With apologies to John Donne, no program is an island. Python programs run in a larger computing environment. They may **input** information from the computer or across the Internet. Or they may **output** information displayed to the screen or written to a file. These are examples of input and output or \"I/O\" in computer science parlance. In this notebook, we will cover the basics of Python I/O by examining string formatting, reading, and writing information to files. Finally, we will delve into a real world example involving snow depth data.\n",

The second, known as the `mode`, describes how you want to open the file and, in particular, if you want to read its contents, or if you aim to modify them. The options are `r` read only, `w` write only, `a` append, and `r+` read and write. The `mode` parameter can be omitted in which case it will default to `r`, read only mode. Be careful with write modes as you can erase files that are already present with the same name.\n",

    "Here we are using the `open()` functions with the `with ... as` Python idiom. The purpose of this idiom is to ensure the file is properly closed when you are finished with it. Otherwise, the responsibility of closing the file is left to the programmer with the [close()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.close) method. The file object, which you will need to get your work done, appears after the `as` keyword. In this case, the file object is `f` and will only be available to you in the indented code block following the `with ... as` idiom. Keeping with its batteries-included philosophy, Python will close the file for you when that code block is done executing.\n",

    "To read the data into the `snowdata` variable, we are using [nested list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#nested-list-comprehensions). In Python, list comprehension is a way of processing sequential data structures including lists, tuples and dictionaries. They take getting used to, but it will be worth your time to understand them as they make code clear and concise especially to other Pythonistas. We will deconstruct this nested list comprehension to better understand it.\n",
    "The entire list comprehension statement is enclosed in brackets: `[entries ... entries[0].isdigit())]`. The first part of the list comprehension, `for line in file`, loops through every line of the file. Each line is processed sequentially into the `line` string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the list comprehension, `for entries in [line.split(\",\")]`, takes the `line` we obtained from the first list comprehension and splits it (according to the commas) into the `entries` list. For example, this line:\n",

    "    936,2016-04-27,,    10.7,    16.7,    -3.9,     1.7,    -5.8,    -2.7,      34,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if (len(entries) > 0 and entries[0].isdigit())` denotes that we only want lines with more than zero entries and that start with a number. This construct helps us get only the lines that contain data and will prevent us from grabbing the header, and will also avoid blank lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end results is a `snowdata` variable that looks like this:\n",

The `\\n` is a newline character that is invisible in the CSV file, but we can see in the `snowdata` list. It tells the computer to display subsequent characters on the next line when printing out to the screen or writing to a file.\n",

From the header information we examined earlier, we know the snow depth field is in the second to last column (remember the `\\n` newline character is in the last column). We have not yet learned about [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) so we will rely upon our newly acquired knowledge of strings to make a text-based histogram. Each bin of the histogram, built by repeating the `-` character according to the snow depth, will be on a separate horizontal line of text.\n",

    "To create our histogram, we will gradually build up a lengthy string as we loop through the snow depth data building our histogram bins. Remember, strings are immutable so you cannot append to them without creating a new string as you loop through the data which is inefficient and frowned upon. Instead, there is a preferred (a.k.a. idiomatic) approach to build such strings with Python. Create an empty list (which is mutable), and append strings to that list. Finally, call the string [join()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) method to link all the strings contained in the list together into one big string. For example,\n"

As we just described, we will create an empty list called `lines` and we will first append the header information. Then we will write a `for` loop to iterate through the snow data into the `d` variable (which is a list of the individual row entries) to grab the date (at index 1) and the depth in the second to last column which we will obtain with the [negative index trick](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#what-s-a-negative-index) (`d[-2]`). Finally, we will create our histogram bins by repeating the \"-\" character according to the snow depth. Python allows strings to be \"multiplied\" to repeat them. For example, <code>\"Z\" \\* 4</code> results in <code>\"ZZZZ\"</code>. We will use this tactic to build the bin.
