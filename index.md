# Unidata's Online Python Training
With support from the National Science Foundation, Unidata is working
to create a collection of online training materials focused
on the use of Python in the atmospheric sciences. While our
examples and scenarios may feature Unidata tools and data
technologies, our aim is to present a generic set of freely
available tools that are generally useful to scientists,
educators, and students in the geosciences, broadly defined.

Unidata staff are actively developing and curating the material
here, but what you see today is an early version of what we
envision for this resource. Please forgive the unfinished nature
of the materials here, and feel free to give us your suggestions
for additions or improvements by contacting @unidata/python.
