# Unidata's Online Python Training
With support from the National Science Foundation, Unidata is working to create
a collection of online training materials focused on the use of Python in the
atmospheric sciences. While our examples and scenarios may feature Unidata tools
and data technologies, our aim is to present a generic set of freely available
tools that are generally useful to scientists, educators, and students in the
geosciences, broadly defined.

Unidata staff are actively developing and curating the material here, but what
you see today is an early version of what we envision for this resource. Please
forgive the unfinished nature of the materials here, and feel free to give us
your suggestions for additions or improvements by contacting
[Unidata Python Support](support.html).

## Basic Python Syntax
Here are some good sources for learning the basics of Python's Syntax:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) has some free lessons on learning Python
- [learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/) also has some free, interactive materials
- The [official](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/index.html) Python tutorial is pretty good as well
